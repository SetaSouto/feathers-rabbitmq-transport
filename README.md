# Feathers RabbitMQ Transport

Configure a `broker` transport that uses a one-way message broker pattern to use to expose the services
of the app.

## Quick start

```bash
npm i feathers-rabbitmq-transport
```

```javascript
// In your app.js
const broker = require('feathers-rabbitmq-transport')

// Expose all the services through RabbitMQ and connecting according
// to the environment variables
app.configure(broker.configure())

// Expose only some services
app.configure(broker.configure({
  sevices: {
    serviceName: [], // All the methods
    otherService: ['create', 'patch'], // Only create and patch methods
  }
}))

// Configure with more options
app.configure(broker.configure({
  connection: {
    host: 'myrabbitmq.com', // Default to process.env.BROKER_HOST
    user: 'user', // default to process.env.BROKER_USER
    password: 'password', // default to process.env.BROKER_PASSWORD
    retry: false, // default to process.env.BROKER_RETRY_CONNECTION === 'true',
  },
  // Configure the prefetch value. Once there are 100 messages outstanding
  // the RabbitMQ server will not send more messages to the method consumer
  // until one ore more have been acknowledge (that is when the method call
  // returns).
  prefetch: 100,
  // Add a postfix to the queue names.
  // This will transform the queue's names from '<service>-<method>' to
  // '<service>-<method><postfix>'.
  queuePostfix: '-development',
}))

// Perform a side effect after connection
app.on('brokerTransportReady', () => {
  // perform a side effect
})

// Or check if the consumers are ready
if (app.get('brokerTransportReady')) {
  // do something
}
```

In another service/instance/microservice/worker:

```javascript
// The package also has usefull Consumer and Producer classes but you
// can use any implementation
const { Producer } = require('feathers-rabbitmq-transport');

const producer = new Producer('<your-exchange>', { key: '<service>.<method>[.<id>]' });
await producer.connect();
producer.send(data);
```

## Configuration

### Connection

The connection options can be provided as environment variables:

- `BROKER_HOST`: To connect to. Example: `localhost`
- `BROKER_USER`: Optional. For authenticated connections. Example `user`.
- `BROKER_PASSWORD`: Optional. For authenticated connections. Example: `mypassword`.
- `BROKER_RETRY_CONNECTION`: Set it as `true` to retry connecting if the first attempt fails.
- `BROKER_TRANSPORT_EXCHANGE`: The topic exchange to use. See
[RabbitMQ docs](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-javascript.html).

Or directly in the configure function:

```javascript
app.configure(broker.configure({
  connection: {
    host: 'myrabbitmq.com', // Default to process.env.BROKER_HOST
    user: 'user', // default to process.env.BROKER_USER
    password: 'password', // default to process.env.BROKER_PASSWORD
    retry: false, // default to process.env.BROKER_RETRY_CONNECTION === 'true',
  }
}))
```

### Prefetch

The prefect value can be useful to throttle the consumer. Once there are `prefetch` messages
outstanding the RabbitMQ server will not send more messages to the service's method's consumer
until one ore more have been acknowledge (that is when the method call returns).

For more information please read the [official docs](http://www.squaremobius.net/amqp.node/channel_api.html#channel_prefetch).

### Queue postfix

Add an aditional postfix to the queue's names. The default queue name is `<service>-<method>` but if you provide this
configuration it will be `<service>-<method><postfix>`.

## How it works

The transport is very simple. As it's only one-way it does not implement the `get` and `find` methods.
It only works with the `create`, `update`, `patch` and `remove` methods.

Each service has a queue for each one of these methods binded with a routing key to a
[topic exchange](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-javascript.html).
The exchange to use must be declared in the `BROKER_TRANSPORT_EXCHANGE` env variable and any producer
can send messages to that exchange with the routing keys:

- `<serviceName>.create`: and the data in the message.
- `<serviceName>.update.<id>`: and the data in the message.
- `<serviceName>.patch.<id>`: and the data in the message.
- `<serviceName>.remove.<id>`: and no data is needed, you can send an empty object.

As we don't want to repeat the creations or updates of the items if the app scale horizontally
we provide a single queue for each (service, method) pair with name `service-method`. So, please
ensure that there is no other consumer/service using the same queue name in the
`BROKER_TRANSPORT_EXCHANGE` exchange.

For the `params` object of the methods we only provide the `provider` property as `broker`. So in
a hook, for example, you can do:

```javascript
function myHook(context) {
  if (context.params.provider === 'broker') {
    // Do something
  }

  return context
}
```

You can explicitly attach the transport to only a subset of the services or only for some methods.
Using the `services` options you explicitly declare which services with which methods must be
exposed through this transport. If no `services` object is given it will expose all the services.
By default it habilitates all the methods, but if you want to expose only some of them you can
provide them like:

```javascript
{
  serviceName: ['create', 'patch'], // Only 'create' and 'patch' methods
  serviceName: [],  // All the methods
}
```

## `brokerTransportReady` event

Is a simple event emitted using the `app` after all the consumers are ready and it does not contains any data.
The package will set the `brokerTransportReady` setting in the app as `true` when its ready too.
